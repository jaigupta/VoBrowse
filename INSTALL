-------------------------------------
Installation instructions for Fedora.
-------------------------------------
Run script install.sh from folder where you have stored the tar.
This will automatically install all dependencies needed and then install VoBrowse in current directory and will also add a symbolic link in /usr/bin/ to the executable. It will also add shortcuts in the XDG directories.


-------------------------------------
Uninstallation
-------------------------------------
Run uninstall.sh from the same folder. This will uninstall VoBrowse. The uninstaller does not do dependency resolution so any dependencies not needed by any other application must be manually uninstalled.
